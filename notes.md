## History

The idea of using Git with decentralised platform initiatives isn't new.  I remember the topic coming up several years ago.

Nonetheless; it appears, that some work has been done previously on a DID:GIT implementation concept, links per below.

Fundamentally - it appears that the concept has ended-up being led down an 'identity' path, with github; rather than an 'identifier' path, via git - as a protocol, etc. 

and then - seemingly failed spectacularly... but idk.

work appears to have migrated to: https://github.com/TrustFrame/authentic-data-specifications 

and i'm certainly in favour of Authentic Data Provenance Logs....  as a concept, without having looked into the work any further than identifying that it exists - at this stage.  noting; it all kinda started with: https://github.com/mit-dig/httpa 

anywho..
